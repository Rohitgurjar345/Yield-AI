## Project info
💡 Project Overview

The Yeald-AI is an AI-powered web application that can classify cow and buffalo breeds from images.

This project addresses real-world challenges such as:<br>
-Rapid identification of animal breeds for farmers, breeders, and veterinarians.<br>
-Avoiding misclassification of non-animal images using an “unknown” class.<br>
-A unified, easy-to-use interactive web interface .<br>

🔑 Key Features

🐄 Cow Breed Classification: Sahiwal, Jersey, Red Sindhi, and more. <br>
🐃 Buffalo Breed Classification: Murrah, Jaffarabadi, Bhadawari, etc.<br>
⚠️ Unknown Class Detection: Detects humans, random objects, and non-target animals.<br>
🖼️ Interactive Web App: Upload an image and see the prediction instantly.<br>
🔍 Object Detection: Pre-checks if a cow or buffalo is present before breed classification and recommendation.<br>
